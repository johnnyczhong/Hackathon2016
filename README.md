* REQUIREMENTS / SETUP *
************************

1. To use, ensure you have a file called apiStorage.py to contain your api key.

Use vi to open .gitignore and add the line "apiStorage.py". (This will prevent you from accidentally uploading your api key)

2. You'll need to install the retinasdk:
   pip install retinasdk

   (For obtaining pip, see https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/ )
