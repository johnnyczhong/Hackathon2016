My husband and I were in San Francisco on business 3 years ago in Pleasanton. We walked into a boutique that had this charming book called "Miette". I immediately bought the book and I realized they were based in San Francisco, just a jump away. We decided to make a day of it. We walked to the Octavia St location from downtown. It was so cut and charming. I love the use of color perfectly placed around the entire room by use of Candy. I love their cute round table displayed with all their hand crafted gems. This place is so charming, I didn't have a problem with purchasing anything here. The young girl was very helpful. The darn little cakes are just the cutest things I had seen. So perfectly fitting for the boutique. The price of the items are perfectly priced for the quality of items they produce. The creations that people are buying take a certain skill to create, and either your good at it or your not. They are great at it! When I was there, I bought the marshmallows, the large caramel, and some meringue cookies. The ingredients used are so predominate in the flavor. The vanilla bean seeds in the marshmallows, the rich flavor of the butter from the caramel, and the light rose flavor from the meringues show the craftsmanship of a true pastry chef. 

It's been a while, but I miss this place. I took the plunge and ordered online, for delivery to Texas. I have to say, I was a bit nervous. Because, I was not sure how they would ship. I ordered yesterday morning and I received my purchase just now by way of UPS next day air. Everything was packed perfectly so nothing was crushed, or broken. I was so happy when I opened my goodie box and ate a Rose-Geranium Macaron, still cold, but not too cold. Really the toffee was in perfect shape as well and did a dance in my mouth. Thank you Miette team for packing my stuff and making me really, really happy!!!! Love from Texas!!!!
