Gabrielle is the BEST here!!! She's been coloring and cutting my hair for about a year now, and I love the result every time. I always make my appointment online, so it's quick and simple and gives an estimate of how long each service will take.

On a whim, I decided to color my hair a dark red / maroon / purple-ish color and randomly chose Gabrielle when I was making my appointment. I have not regretted it since. Gaby put in beautiful balayage highlights and really puts in the time and care each time I come back for a color refresh (approx. every 7 weeks). Rather than rushing, she always double checks that the dye has soaked into my hair enough before washing it out. She is great with color and always has fun suggestions if you want to try something slightly different. Oh, and she also styles and curls my hair every time before I leave, which is a nice touch.

This salon is a bit pricey, but definitely worth it if you are thinking about coloring your hair!!
