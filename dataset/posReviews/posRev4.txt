This camera fully met my expectations for an affordable, long zoom camera. Prior to purchasing this camera I had been using the camera on my cell phone. While my cell phone takes decent pictures, it does not have any optical zoom. I can digitally zoom a little bit with it but those pictures look blurry. I got this camera primarily for it's 28x optical zoom. This really gives you the ability to take pictures that just aren't possible with the cell phone. I can get more people in an indoor shoot because the lens is a wider angle than on my cell phone camera and with the 28x optical zoom it opens up a whole new world, especially for outdoor shoots. l also like that it uses regular AA batteries which are available just about everywhere. At a price of less than $200 it is an excellent value.
