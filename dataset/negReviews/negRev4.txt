if you happen to turn on the camera without removing the lens cap, this camera will break itself. I know that is my fault for making this mistake, but think about how many people will also do this same thing. It's a very easy mistake to make and I think the camera could have been designed better. It shouldn't be so easy to break. Otherwise, it's an EXCELLENT camera that I can't use now. It's not even a good doorstop.... too light, too small
