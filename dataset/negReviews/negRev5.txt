I thought something seemed off when I opened the package, and when I put the jeans on the cut was different from the existing pair I have. I compared the tags, and I'm 99% sure that the pair I received are knockoffs. The fit was mostly ok. The quality was more like $20 jeans - definitely inferior in construction and quality compared to my existing pair... but they totally are not Levi's or worth the $44. Photo comparison of the label against real Levi's - the dark pair (outside/upper in the photos) are what I ordered, the lighter pair (inside/lower in the photos) are real Levi's.
