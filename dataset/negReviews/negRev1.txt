Honestly, I would have given the ramen closer to 5 stars; the tan tan spicy ramen was awesome.

TL;DR- good food. Okay service. Shitty food timing. 

They clearly still need to figure out the service aspect. First thing I did was order wine and edamame. My date and I sat there for about another 20 minutes before our waitress took our appetizer and entree order (despite the fact that we had that "closed menu ready to order" look for over 15 minutes). 

Ramen came and was awesome! Half way through our ramen, the appetizers came (womp womp, little late). Was pretty much too full to eat them, but my taste of the chicken bun was nice. 

Here's the kicker- after we finished the appetizers, the owner came to deliver the edamame (he was clearly confused why we would order edamame so late in a meal- because who the hell would do that, amirite?!). He apologized that it came 45 minutes late, which was nice, but still charges us the 4$.... 

That being said, I'll try it again soon!
