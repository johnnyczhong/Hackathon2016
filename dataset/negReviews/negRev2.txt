Worst updo ever. I was a bridesmaid in my best friend's wedding last weekend, and we all got updo's here. Two were okay, two were not great. Thank god the bride's hair was good.

Mine was just this mass of nasty brushed back curls, with a few pinned to the top of my head. Somehow it looked very complicated - like in Elizabethan period movies were they had these complicated arrangements of unwashed hair. Never. Again.
