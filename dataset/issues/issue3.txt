I've already spent 36 tedious hours downloading and installing the game and when it reaches to the point of launching it (which excites me the most) it gave an error. Numerous people as I've browsed through the net complains about this and although solutions were presented it came to no avail. It's an urgent problem and must be dealt with proper attention. I hope there would be a pile of solution to this because i'm no expert on this technicalities.
