I encountered the avast error. But before I saw how to fix it, I uninstalled league of legends.

Note. I have uninstalled the game.
I am going in from scratch.
The installer will not patch properly.

Now I have updated my drivers, downloaded game multiple times, turned off firewall, allowed avast permission for lol, deleted said files on support page, reinstalled over and over.

There is no PLAY button.

There is a LAUNCH button that you can click, but it will just go gray and nothing will happen.

PLEASE HELP!

I've spent over 20 hours trying to fix this and followed multiple instructions involving rebooting and reinstalling league.
